- validate or clarify the format of latitude and longitude
- use consistent "leaders" > "coordinators"
- figure out how to explain hub card visibility... "visible on hub card" + tooltip?
- clarify that updates are not immediate (or schedule them more frequently)
- explicit signup link
- control who receives email
- soft deletion
- spam folder notice
- add extra non-map fields like hub size
- edit leader emails

future:
- alternate views for hub list
- proper domain + email (hubhub.sunrisemovement.org?)

extra:
- increment number of self-updates? :D
